# Pick My Bruin

## Setup
1. Install `docker` and `docker-compose`. 
2. run `make build && make run` in the root directory (this one)
3. In another window, run `make init_db` to set up some default values for everything


## Project Organization

Simplified tree diagram
``` /usr/bin/tree
.  # Contains docker setup and Makefile
├── docker-compose.yml  # defines setup of PostgreSQL and Django
├── Dockerfile  # defines pickmybruin/backend Docker image
├── initialize.sh  # sets up Django container (runs migrations and then boots server)
├── Makefile  # contains very useful helper commands
└── src  # Contains all Django code
    ├── pickmybruin  # Contains code relating to the entire website
    │   ├── keys.py  # put confidential info in here
    │   ├── settings.py  # global settings (please keep confidential info out of here)
    │   ├── urls.py  # global URLs (usually imports app URLs too)
    └── users  # One app for just users
        ├── admin.py  # sets up /admin pages
        ├── models.py  # contains class declarations and methods
        ├── serializers.py  # contains serializers for classes 
        ├── tests.py  # necessary (pls)
        ├── urls.py  # sets up app specific URLs
        └── views.py  # sets up responses to URLs
```

## Makefile commands
- `make build` creates the `pickmybruin/backend` image
- `make run` starts up the PostgreSQL and Django containers
- `make restart` restarts the Django container (useful when you edit code)
- `make ssh` starts a bash session in the latest Django container
- `make run_command` runs a command inside the latest Django container
    - `make run_command cmd="echo hi"` will run `echo hi` inside the latest Django container
- `make shell` starts a `manage.py shell_plus` inside the latest Django container
    - If you don't know what this means, that's fine
- `make test` runs test.py use `args=--keepdb` to use previous test database

## How to add a new app
1. Run `make run_command cmd="src/manage.py startapp $APPNAME`
    - This creates a new skeleton folder for your new app
2. YOU MUST ADD THIS APP TO `src/pickmybruin/settings.py` `INSTALLED_APPS` FOR THE APP TO BE DISCOVEREDR
    - `'users',` adds the `users` app to the Django project.  Big surprise.
3. Add your code
4. Add tests to `tests.py`
5. Add your models to `admin.py`
6. Import your urls.py in `src/pickmybruin/urls.py`
7. Run the tests
8. Submit a PR

## How to do authorized requests
1. Login
  - Only the `username` and `password` fields in the input should ever change
  - Only the `access_token` field in the output really matters

2. Use the `access_token` to do requests
  - MUST BE `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`
  - Django will automatically identify the user with the token

## Current Database Schema (Will probably be outdated soon)

### NOTE: you don't really need to understand this, but this is how Django will create tables for the models

--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
1 | me@marktai.com | Mark | Tai | verysecurepassword

#### Profile Table

id | user_id | bio 
--- | --- | --- 
1 | 1 | Let me know if these examples suck 
2 | 2 | [marktai.com/#corgis](https://www.marktai.com/#corgis) for all your corgi needs 


#### Major Table

id | name 
--- | --- 
1 | CS 


#### Mentor Table

id | profile_id | major_id | bio 
--- | --- | --- | ---
